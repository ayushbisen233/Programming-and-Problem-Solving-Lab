1.1.18. Palindrome checker

Write a Python program to find whether a given string is a palindrome or not.



Note: A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards as forward.

For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same in both directions, while "hello" is not.



Input Format:

The input should be a string.


Output Format:

If the given string is a palindrome, print "palindrome".
Otherwise, print "not a palindrome".

Sample Test Cases

Explorer

palindrome.py
s=input()
if s==s[::-1]:
	print('palindrome')
else:
	print('not a palindrome')

1.1.26. Display the car details




Follow the instructions to create a Python program modeling cars with specific types: Car1 and Car2. Begin by defining a base class Car with attributes brand, price, model, and color. Subsequently, create two derived classes, Car1 and Car2, both inheriting from the Car class. Each derived class should introduce its attributes, and:

Implement a method display_details in the base class Car to print the common attributes (brand, price, model, color).
Override the display_details method in each derived class (Car1 and Car2) to print the brand, price, model, and color respectively.


Input Format:

For Car1:

The first line contains the brand, price, model, and color of the Car1, separated by spaces.
For Car2:

The first line contains the brand, price, model, and color of the Car2, separated by spaces.


Output Format:

The first four lines should display information about the Car1, including the brand, price, model, and color.
The second four lines should display information about the Car2, including the brand, price, model, and color.


Note:

Price must be a positive float.
Refer to the displayed test cases for better understanding.
For simplicity, code for reading inputs has already been provided.

carDetails.py
class Car:
	# write your code here...
	def __init__(self,brand,price,model,color): 
		self.brand = brand
		self.price = price
		self.model = model
		self.color = color

	def display_details(self):
		print(self.brand)
		print(self.price)
		print(self.model)
		print(self.color)





def get_car_details():
	brand = input("brand: ")
	price = float(input("price: "))
	model = input("model: ")
	color = input("color: ")
	return brand, price, model, color

print("Details for Car 1:")
car1_brand, car1_price, car1_model, car1_color = get_car_details()

# create an object car1
car1 = Car(car1_brand, car1_price, car1_model, car1_color)

print("Details for Car 2:")
car2_brand, car2_price, car2_model, car2_color = get_car_details()

# Create the second car object
car2 = Car(car2_brand, car2_price, car2_model, car2_color)

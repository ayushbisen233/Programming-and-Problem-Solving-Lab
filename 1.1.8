1.1.8. Program to perform union, intersection, and difference operations on sets.
Write a Python program to perform union, intersection and difference operations on Set A and Set B.



Input Format:

Set A: The first input prompts for a space-separated list of integers for Set A.
Set B: The second input prompts for a space-separated list of integers for Set B.


Output Format:

Union: The first line should display the union of both sets.
Intersection: The second line should display the intersection of both sets.
Difference: The third line should display the difference between Set A and Set B.


Note:

Please refer to the visible test cases for better understanding.

Sample Test Cases

setoperations.py
a = list(map(int,input("Set A: ").split()))
A = set(a)
b = list(map(int,input("Set B: ").split()))
B = set(b)
print("Union: ",A|B)
print("Intersection: ",A&B)
print("Difference: ",A-B)
